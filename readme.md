This project aims to produce a model that can tell apart cat images from dog images. To achieve this the kaggle "cat vs dog" dataset was used. The project uses a 5 layer convolutional neural network(cnn) to achieve its goal.

Training images should be placed in the data folder and be divided into 2 subfolders named "cat" and "dog".

To run the training, simply run the cnn_train script.
To test, run the ui.py script.
